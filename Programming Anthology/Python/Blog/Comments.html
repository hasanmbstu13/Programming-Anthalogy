        <h3>
            The Why and How of Comments
        </h3>
        <p>
            As your programs get longer and more complicated, some additional English explanation can be used to help you and other programmers read your code. These explanations called <em>comments</em> document your code, much the way docstrings document your functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            A comment begins with the number sign character (<code>#</code>) and goes until the end of the line. One name for this character is the hash character. Python ignores any lines that start with this character.
        </p>
        <p>
            Comments are intended for programmers to read, and are usually there to explain the purpose of a function, as well as to describe relationships between your variables. Comments are to help you, and anyone else who is reading/using your code, to remember or understand the purpose of a given variable or function in a program.
